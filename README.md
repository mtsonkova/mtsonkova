I am a passionate QA with a sharp eye and strong attention to details. After working more than 5 years as a manual QA, I am eager to dive deep and explore the field of QA Automation. 

To achieve my goal I have selected the following resources to practice test automation:
### UI testing
- [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/)
I chose this site because it is easy to automate and strait forward. This is a good first time project or just a side resource if you want to test a new tool or explore a new programming language.

  - [Manual testing repository](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabs-Testing-Project/tree/main) - **done**

  - [Autonation testing repository with Playwright and JavaScript](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabs-Testing-Project-Automation-with-Playwright) - **done**

  - [Automation testing repository with Selenium and java](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabs-Selenium-Framework-with-Java.git) - **done**

- [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/) E-Commerce Test Project [Live TechPanda](http://live.techpanda.org/)
Similar to Swag Labs but with a lot more complex structure. This website mimics partly [Open Cart](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=cms/demo) functionality. It also provide access to backend admin panel so you can split the testing to frontend and backend parts. However the backend functionality is limited. You cannot delete created user or change the price of a product. You cannot add new products to the database as well. Yet you have permission to change the status of an order to Edit, Cancel, Put on Hold, Invoice, Ship and Reorder. These are actions that bring real monetary value to the owner of the online store. - **to do**

- [XYZ Bank](https://www.globalsqa.com/angularJs-protractor/BankingProject/#/login)
A simple banking application created for testing purposes. It features two profles: Customer and Bank Manager. - **to do**

- [Contact List App](https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/) 
Suitable for UI and API testing. You can test create new account, log in, and add new user. When adding new user you can practice traversing table rows and cells to obtain specific data. - **on hold -> will try Playwright with Typescript for both UI and API tests**

### API Testing

- [Contact List App](https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/)
Supports Get, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE for both users and contacts. - **Try RestAssured with Java**

- [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/)
Supports Get, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE for pet, store and user. Allows choice between HTTP and HTTPS schemes. Allows testing of authorization. - **in progress**
  - [Petstore API testing with Java and RestAssured](https://github.com/mtsonkova/Petstore-RestAPITest-with-RestAssured)

- [restful-booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html)
Requires authorization token to access the PUT and DELETE /booking endpoints - **to do**
