I am a passionate QA with a sharp eye and strong attention to detail. After working more than 5 years as a Manual QA, Iâ€™ve transitioned into Automation QA, gaining 9 months of experience with Playwright and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m excited to continue growing in this field with a strong interest in TypeScript.

Here are a few practice projects Iâ€™ve built using popular demo websites to sharpen my automation skills::

## UI testing

### Swag Labs [link](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

I chose this site because it is easy to automate and strait forward. This is a good first time project or just a side resource if you want to test a new tool or explore a new programming language.
