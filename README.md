I am a passionate QA with a sharp eye and strong attention to details. After working more than 5 years as a manual QA, I am eager to dive deep and explore the field of QA Automation. I am currently learning Playwright with JavaScript.

[project code](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabsTestAutomation)

This project is perfect for beginners in test automation. SwagLabs reperesents a real live eCommerce site, yet it is simplified. The site misses Registration form, but at the same time provides the following user options:
  * **standard_user:** normal user behavior with no built in restrictions;
  * **locked_out_user:** error message is displayed when attempting to log in with this user;
  * **problem user:** built in errors in the Checkout Your information section making it imposible to fill in all the fields and submit the form;
  *  **performance_glitch_user:** created specifically for performance tests with huge delays in the website functionality in all sections;
  *  **error_user:** built in error in the Checkout Overview page making the **Finish** button unresponsive, thus the purchase cannot be completed;
  *  **visual_user:** missplaced Checkout button inside the shopping cart. Shopping cart icon missaligned and overlaps the horizontall line in upper secion of the website;
