I am a passionate QA with a sharp eye and strong attention to details. After working more than 5 years as a manual QA, I am eager to dive deep and explore the field of QA Automation. 

To achieve my goal I have selected the following resources to practice test automation:

## UI testing

### Swag Labs [link](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

I chose this site because it is easy to automate and strait forward. This is a good first time project or just a side resource if you want to test a new tool or explore a new programming language.

  - [Manual testing repository](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabs-Testing-Project/tree/main)

  - [Autonation testing repository with Playwright and JavaScript](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabs-Testing-Project-Automation-with-Playwright)

  - [Automation testing repository with Selenium and java](https://github.com/mtsonkova/SwagLabs-Selenium-Framework-with-Java.git)

### Guru99 E-Commerce Test Project [Live TechPanda](http://live.techpanda.org/)

Similar to Swag Labs but with a lot more complex structure. This website partially looks like [Open Cart](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=cms/demo) but with limited functionality. You also have access to [admin pannel](https://live.techpanda.org/index.php/backendlogin), but not all features work.  Yet you have permission to change the status of an order to Put on Hold and Invoice. These are actions that bring real monetary value to the owner of the online store.

**Testing put on hold as the website currently experience some issues and is not stable**

## API Testing

### Swagger Petstore [link](https://petstore.swagger.io/)

Supports Get, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE for pet, store and user. Allows choice between HTTP and HTTPS schemes. Allows testing of authorization.

### restful-booker [link](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html)

Requires authorization token to access the PUT and DELETE /booking endpoints -
